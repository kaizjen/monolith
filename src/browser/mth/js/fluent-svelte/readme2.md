## Hello, me again.

The `fluent-svelte` library was compiled by me. It took a couple of search-and-replace in vscode here and there, but it actually didn't take that long!

It was probably easier to just use a bundler at this point, I'll admit it. But, unfortunately, the sunk cost fallacy has got me this time.
So, enjoy looking at all this circus.
